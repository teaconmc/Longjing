## 问题反馈 Reporting issue

构建失败不一定意味着被构建的项目有问题，还有可能是龙井系统本身的问题。这样的情况已经出现过不止一次了。
如果你确定龙井本身有问题，欢迎在我们的问题追踪器内反馈。或是直接向我们发起 PR。

A build failure does not implies that the project being built has issue(s); it could very well be an issue inside Longjing. 
There have been cases where issues from Longjing itself cause build failures. 
If you believe that Longjing itself is causing issues, feel free to report in our issue tracker. 
Pull requests are more than welcome.
